## Application of LDA-QDA on merged data.

Summary on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) has been attached with the application on unrotated data, link to which is attached [here](https://github.com/shubha3/Senior-Mentorship-Summer-Project-2021/blob/main/Application-on-Unrotated-data/LDA-QDA/Summary%20on%20LDA%20and%20QDA.pdf).

We have applied the learning models of LDA and QDA after merging the rotated and unrotated MNIST datasets.
